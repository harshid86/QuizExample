# QuizExample

This is a stripped down version of an early prototype of an interactive Quiz i built for a client.
All references to the client have been removed and also bits of the functionality has been removed at the request of the client.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase JS & PHP code written by me.

Main areas of functionality are in the following files:

* JS functionality:
 * /inc/view/play.twig
 * /js/*

* PHP functionality
 * /inc/routes.php
 * /inc/entities.php
